This is my first attempt at a funcionable program that worked with user input.
The program consists of 2 parts:
1. User registration with a few required information pieces.
2. A second screen where the user can write in a textarea and save it anywhere in the computer

The information the user uses for the registration has to follow some rules and information like
name and email must be unique and not be alredy in use.

I used tkinter to create the GUI and sqlite3 to create my Database.
